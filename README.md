# Corona_Tracker
I have Created A dashboard/Report Using Corona statistics That i have fetched from MyGov.in for India and WHO for Corona Statistical Data &amp; to analyze this data and refine it i have used Power BI Used powered by Microsoft.

First step :- It was to various sites and api to  fetch the data that i will be using to make my dashboard , as it was really hard to get.

Second step:- Now as, i have fetched the data this data need to be transformed and altered in such a way that this will help we analyze various features easily that i will be using in my dashboard.

Third Step:- My dashboard is divided into two pages , The first page corona statistical data in chart and google maps form that was fetched from MyGov.in Website & The second page was created on the world data on corona available on WHO official website.
